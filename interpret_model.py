"""
    The `interpret_command` function checks if a given command includes a specific target and returns
    `True` if it does, otherwise it returns `False`.
    
    :param command: The `command` parameter is a string that represents a command or instruction. It
    could be a user input or a command received from another system
    :param target: The `target` parameter in the `interpret_command` function represents the specific
    target or subject on which the command is being executed. It is used to determine if the command is
    requesting to run tests on the specified target
    :return: The function `interpret_command` returns `True` if the command contains the phrase "Run
    tests on {target}", and `False` otherwise.
